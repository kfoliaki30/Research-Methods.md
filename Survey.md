Survey questions
* According to Hitchings 2011, most people focus their research on the issues rather than the experiences of the people. 
  * For example, hot tempearture leds to people wearing different clothes. these studies have tended to ask people about how they conceptualize this concept and the
sources of information they trust, rather than about how they deal with the matter of already occurring climate change in terms of outdoor temperature swings, the march of the seasons, and other aspects
of immediate weather that have always been with us and which throw up various problems and possibilities for behavioral respons (this is copy paste from Hithchings paper)
* Maybe important not to just look at the issues but understanding what the future may bring and understand how to adapt to those circumstances
* So looking at understanding how people can relate their energy behaviour and consumption to future circumstances
* look at how traditional clothes influence energy consumption
